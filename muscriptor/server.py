"""FastAPI server exposing transcription as an SSE event stream.

POST /transcribe with an audio file (multipart/form-data field `file`; WAV,
or any format soundfile/libsndfile can read — mp3, flac, ogg, m4a, …) returns
`text/event-stream`. Each event's data is a JSON dict tagged by `type`:
`start` / `end` note events (same shape as `muscriptor.main._event_to_dict`),
`progress` chunk anchors (`{completed, total}`), and a final
`transcription_complete` event carrying the base64-encoded .mid file (`data`)
plus the detected `beat_grid`
(`{bpm, beats_per_bar, first_downbeat, onset_delay}`, or null if no tempo was
found). `onset_delay` is how late the streamed note times are against those
beats: the MIDI has it taken out already, an SSE consumer has to subtract it.

POST /transcribe/midi takes the same upload but blocks until transcription
completes and returns the raw `audio/midi` bytes directly (no SSE, no
base64), with a `Content-Disposition: attachment` header. Audio longer than
15 minutes is rejected with 413.

POST /sheets takes a MIDI upload instead of audio (the `quantized_midi` from
/transcribe, with `quantized=true`) and returns every file
`muscriptor.utils.sheets.write_sheets` engraves from it — MusicXML, the full
score, one PDF per instrument — as a single uncompressed zip. It needs
MuseScore 4+ on the server, and answers 503 when there is none.
